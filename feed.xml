            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lockheed Martin&#8217;s Blackbirds are remembered as visionary stealth planes and Cold War-era assets. They were made with titanium and could fly at Mach-3 speeds. A common problem with these planes was that they would drip oil at flying temperatures. Instead of fixing the engineering problems of these planes, the Air Force adopted a new term: &#8220;<strong>drip-rate</strong>.&#8221; </p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>drip rate - </strong>let this be a colloquial term that means it&#8217;s too complicated&#8230; let&#8217;s throw money ($200K/hr&#185;) at the problem and hope it works!</p></div><p>It&#8217;s ridiculous how inefficient defense spending is even today. Sam Lisbonne, project manager @ Saronic (VC-backed defense startup), wrote a beautiful paper while at Stanford about the Special Operation Force&#8217;s (SOF) spending habits.&#178; He notes how acquisitions, technology, and logistics (AT&amp;L) expansions were growing in staff, but becoming more counterintuitive to what SOF operators wanted on the field. He elaborates saying the expanding jurisdiction of the Program of Records is just an overhead burden that &#8220;threatens operator flexibility.&#8221;&#178; Lisbonne thinks this is a trendsetter for SOF to operate as a service arm instead of a branch. </p><p>A Navy SEAL or SF Operator can go into much more detail than I can about whether the Program of Records is doing its job or not. I have no operational field experience, but it seems stupidly apparent that:</p><blockquote><ol><li><p>US still has a &#8216;<strong>drip rate</strong>&#8217; mindset, at least for military spending</p></li><li><p>Spec Ops want more</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>There is a HUGE nearly $1T market to fill by 2030. Anybody who can provide the wants of operators and convince the Department of Defense they are better than Lockheed or Northrop can make some serious cash. Selling trust itself is a behemoth-sized problem, but at least now we have a framework to work with.</p><p>Last week, Austin-based startup, Saronic stopped by campus and spoke to us about this growing market gap. Justin Davis, ex-Navy SEAL and Head of Strategy, gave us insight into the problems he faced on the field.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg" width="476" height="357.3269230769231" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1093,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:476,&quot;bytes&quot;:927197,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F515e3e4f-6b53-42f7-b7e7-96dafd0a0163_2100x1576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Some of the notes I took from the talk.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exposure is the foundation of success. It comes in many forms, most of which are subtle and many of which are taken for granted. A personalized Instagram feed, the friends you hang out with, or a professor&#8217;s office hours can all make up your <strong>information diet</strong>. This is super important in understanding perspective and the detrimental effects of a lack of exposure.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Information diet </strong>- the lifeline to your personality. Anything you look at, hear, taste, or get stimulated by. If you consume it, it changes the way you think.</p></div><p>Now exposure, as I view it, is made up of unstructured education and structured education. Unstructured education is largely unpredictable and everything outside the classroom, while structured education is academic and typically mandatory.</p><p>An ideal classroom is a safe haven for discussion and current information. It should provide the building blocks to learning how to learn and most importantly be an empowering environment where students can contradict each other.</p><p>I had the privilege to teach at Odom Elementary for these past few months and create lesson plans oriented toward chemistry experiments. I realized how prevalent didactic learning is in the classroom&#8212; even today. 3rd graders in my class completed worksheets as a form of assessment and usually consumed information for the majority of class time. Discussion is really important and we always encourage it which is great, but it's not enough.</p><p>Looking back on my own academic career, I wish there had been a bigger emphasis on value creation sooner. Sitting in a seat for an hour and listening is a life skill, it builds patience, resilience, and grit, but it shouldn&#8217;t take away from how much is learned through making something. Going through the mental struggle of brainstorming approaches, finding parts, and most importantly <strong>being resourceful</strong> is lost when the majority of schooling is didactic.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Being resourceful </strong>- Accepting the cards you're dealt with and still wanting to create something useful. It's a mindset that schools should be prioritizing.</p></div><p>Private schools, in my limited experience, act on this. Magellan International, a private school I am interning at, takes a more hands-on approach. They value physical collaboration in learning and prioritize giving students agency. A common misconception about maker spaces is that they are expensive. They don&#8217;t have to be. Patrick Benfield, Innovation Director (also my boss), and our team had a lesson where 5th-grade students made buildings and furniture with scratch paper, scissors, and tape. They are learning how to be resourceful and create value.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic" width="272" height="362.6043956043956" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:272,&quot;bytes&quot;:2118526,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a0fbbb0-43d2-49e4-821a-385f18c127fe.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Here&#8217;s the house I made with my 5th graders.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greek goddess Dike is credited for the birth of Lady Justice; however, her death can be credited to the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems as though post-pandemic America has revived her reputation, but the scars of quarantining remain. The lack of government order combined with the political elections of 2020 begs the question: </p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Was politicizing a scientific problem the most effective method for solving it?</strong> </p></div><p>I often wonder whether the government should have delayed the 2020 election during a pandemic. Could the average American remain isolated and have the mental tolerance to vote for a new president? Historically, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#8217;s 12-year term is seen as unprecedented (no pun intended). Obtaining nearly &#8532; popular vote is a feat in itself and is applaudable, but remaining as the only president to serve for a third term is credited&#8211; in my opinion&#8211; to his environment not so much as his resume. The pandemic is nowhere near as bad as World War II on magnitudes bigger than numbers can describe. Infrastructure is a lot better now, the internet exists, and the supply chain is much more robust. I think you get the point. In fact, if the United States can rebound from the hurdles of World War II, then the pandemic should be a walk in the park&#8211; on paper. Contrarily, many politicians compared the COVID-19 pandemic to breaking many &#8220;firsts since World War II.&#8221; This is a testament to misinformation and bias which ultimately lead to such a disastrous response to a relatively simpler problem.&nbsp;</p><p>A main contributor to the complexity of the pandemic was social media. Content creation is a good thing for society, and the alpha is the creation aspect itself. However, when the line between freedom of speech and actively harmful information is blurred, this casts doubts and leads to inevitable conflict. To have the private industry, whose primary and arguably only concern is maximizing return on total customer acquisition costs, dictate misinformation legislature is like having middle school students write lesson plans for teachers to use. It could work if you&#8217;re lucky or you find a super-self-aware middle school student. But at the end of the day, teachers need to provide a quantifiable amount of guidance. You can&#8217;t have the student teach the class and hope they are talking sense. There needs to be regulation. It's the same thing here. When you have Meta, X, and YouTube take the bare minimum steps to change the information diet of their users, they end up promoting factually incorrect information. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png" width="706" height="533.9125" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:847,&quot;width&quot;:1120,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:706,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F135a6dbc-c03e-481d-afa2-85753682bd13_1120x847.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan organization, published an article that stated that &#8220;nearly eight in ten believe or are unsure about at least one common falsehood about COVID-19 or the vaccine.&#8221;</figcaption></figure></div><p>Note I am not talking about bias, I am only focused on misinformation. Bias leads to multiple truths based on anecdotal experiences; however, misinformation is factually WRONG information from all viewpoints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ethically speaking, the function ontology of changing the constitution to incorporate misinformation is abstractly super useful, but functionally impossible to implement. Just the thought of this politicizes the pandemic, and maybe that's a good thing long-term. However, when people are dying in the thousands on a daily basis that is secondary. Instead, saving lives should be prioritized. </p><p>The solution presented was quarantine. </p><p>It was scientifically proven to work, but if a family cannot stay afloat because of isolation, does it mean they should isolate themselves? This is an impossible question to answer, and I have a lot of respect for politicians who can answer this without getting rotten tomatoes thrown at themselves. Fundamentally though, the government provided to socially isolate, but political orientations led to Americans following rules set in place or not. A Republican may have viewed the solution of quarantine as unconstitutional whereas a Democrat may have viewed quarantine as ethical. This is not the issue. Having a bi-partisan plan to solve the pandemic is. When roughly half the country is doing the exact opposite as the other, it makes progress much harder to quantify.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Napkin Theory (nt) started way back before I left the womb of my mother. My parents bought the domain for whatever whimsical reason they did but never acted on it. I liked the name, it stuck. Someone referred me to SubStacks to start writing, and now we&#8217;re here.</p><p>Hopefully, my newsletter is a no-bullshit routine where you learn to care about someone who has nothing to do with you (me) on their journey of <em>life</em>. I am a movie: not the main character, not the director, not the spot-boy. I don&#8217;t know where I fit in all this. I don&#8217;t even know if a movie is the right way to analogize my entire life, but we&#8217;ll find out.</p><p>I am going to write about my college experience, my napkin theory ideas, my personal opinions on bankers, why I took notes in a fifth-grade classroom, the barbarism lost in post-modern America, and any other tenderfoot idea I come across.</p><p>At the end of the day, I have been living for 17 years. More like consuming for 17 years, and now I got into a <em>prestigious</em> college (a debate for another day) and feel the urge to start creating. This transition from consuming to creating is very very very very very difficult but unexpectedly extremely rewarding. I don&#8217;t mean materialistically, but rather mentally. It&#8217;s like the past four years of college applications and &#8220;high school&#8221; got replaced with a <strong>newfound freedom</strong> to do something with my life. </p><div class="pullquote"><p>newfound freedom - a buzzword, I hate them, but I use them anyway. this one means to act on the open grassland I have in front of me the same way the 13 colonies colonized Texas. Metaphorically.</p></div><p>Self-identity for a type-A person trying to not be type-A is like giving a monkey an apple and asking it to enjoy it the same way it would a banana. It&#8217;s impossible. My hope is that by forcing myself to write the same way I think, I am making the impossible possible.</p>]]></content:encoded>
